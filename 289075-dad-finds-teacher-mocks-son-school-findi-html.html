Ultimately it secures the bond between teacher and students and facilitates their learning.</p><p class=dh>Despite many teachers being abreast with the characteristics of an elementary educator, not many are ready to implement it in their relationship with the kids.</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, a Pennsylvanian parent, Chris, was a victim of one of such teachers. In 2019, the father discovered that his son's teacher was far from being kind or empathetic.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>KAMDYN COMES HOME WITH SHOCKING COMMENT ON HIS MATH TEST</strong></p><p class=dh>Chris's 2nd-grader, Kamdyn Piland from Valley View Elementary School, had participated in a math-timed quiz, where he was supposed to answer as many questions in three minutes.</p><p class=dh>When the results came back, the boy who answered thirteen questions in three minutes noticed a sad face emoji, accompanied by a few highlighted words strung together above his sheet that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://web.facebook.com/cpiland/posts/10156956671368828?_rdc=1&_rdr">read</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Absolutely pathetic. He answered 13 in 3 min! sad."</p><p class=dh>Kamdyn later <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/absolutely-pathetic-note-2nd-grader-math-quiz-does-not-add-for-dad/IjbXUVFJKKO5sYQ1pWR4QP/>told</a> a news outlet that his teacher's comment was demeaning. He maintained that "she made me really sad and upset…And it was really mean to do."</p><p class=dh>Once his dad caught sight of the comment, he reached out to the teacher. The dissatisfied parent asked how such harsh words would help his son.</p><p class=dh>However, rather than show genuine remorse, the teacher, identified as Alyssa Rupp Bohenek, who had been working in the school since 2013, took the report lightly, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://en.newsner.com/news/teacher-writes-absolutely-pathetic-on-7-year-olds-math-paper/>answering</a> the dad with:</p><p class=dh>"I'm sorry you feel this way."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A DISTRAUGHT DAD CRIES OUT & NETIZENS REACT</strong></p><p class=dh>Chris did not get the response he had hoped for, so the distraught dad took to social media to tender his case. He shared a photo of the test sheet and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.facebook.com/cpiland/posts/10156956671368828?__cft__[0]=AZVh2hDLgQBnIAjIypPcWPD9d31Zfpd7urO8Rii1feTTVi2KaSQM3sYbmDEzFSOk2370eUGhQmOVfpuxbVTiAostiugNS6Q-O5rdtLFMp9sXjrAsTc9T00WpPfWZM6CGk9g&__tn__=%2CO*F">quipped</a>:</p><p class=dh>"My son Kamdyn's teacher has been so rude to him and myself all year. He comes home with this and I am beyond frustrated that someone would write this on a child's work. Such great motivation."</p><p class=dh>Chris's Facebook post attracted reactions from many people who commented on their different views. A few maintained that it was impossible for a teacher to scribble such words.</p><p class=dh>However, a considerable number of commenters sided with the disgruntled dad. They were shocked that a 2nd-grader would receive such a comment on his sheet. Another faction agreed that Kamdyn should have done better, thereby supporting the teacher's style of criticism.</p><p class=dh>In the end, many moved the motion to have the teacher sacked, while others who frowned on the poor treatment of the student stated that Bohenek should be punished but not lose her job.

He proved that his concern was with his son's education and not publicity. So after the post, he chose to take the 2nd-grader out of the teacher's class.</p><p class=dh>The Pennsylvanian dad confessed that his focus was to highlight the teacher's poor tactics and deter other educators from taking the same route. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://en.newsner.com/news/teacher-writes-absolutely-pathetic-on-7-year-olds-math-paper/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Maybe it'll be taken seriously now and it'll keep it from happening to other teachers and other students."</p><p class=dh>The school's superintendent Rose Minniti <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6940265/Teacher-wrote-pathetic-boys-test-faces-calls-fired.html>mentioned</a> that Bohenek was being investigated, and the school's verdict would be based on facts.</p><p class=dh>This story shows that <a class="me a" href=#>kids</a> never improve under destructive criticism.
