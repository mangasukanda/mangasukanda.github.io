The supermodel was seen on her way to Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles. She was sitting in the backseat of a Chevy Suburban, her feet hanging out the window. Delevingne was two hours late for her journey aboard Jay-private Z’s jet, according to Page Six, but it never took off. Instead, they deboarded the aircraft after 45 minutes for unclear reasons.</p><p>When she returned to the tarmac, she seemed unkempt and was spotted staggering about shoeless.

Fans have even flocked to Twitter to express their worry about her health. “This is awful, I honestly assumed it was someone off the street until I read the name,” one person said. “100%. Another person wrote, “Textbook methamphetamine mannerisms.”</p><h2>Cara Delevingne Is Supposedly High On Drugs</h2><p>Delevingne’s team has not commented on the matter, but an event in May 2013 is one of the reasons admirers believe she has a drug problem. The Daily Mail said at the time that the Only Murders in the Building actress was looking for her home keys when a sachet of white powder flew out of her handbag.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Cara-Delevingne-1.jpg alt="Cara Delevingne" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She hurriedly slipped on one of her white shoes and looked away from the cameras. She didn’t move her foot till she could cover it with her large black purse. Unfortunately, the paparazzi were filming her every step. Then, in August 2013, the retail company H&M fired her because they have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs. Delevingne was the model for H&M’s Divided collection.</p><p>In July 2022, she appeared on The Tonight Show, hosted by Jimmy Fallon. Fans observed she was speaking quickly while fumbling over phrases, and during a card trick, viewers spotted her hands quivering as she presented the cards on camera. “Can you see how much my hand is shaking?” she said, trying to sound casual. If it was part of the ruse, the host responded.</p><h2>Cara Delevingne Opens Up About Her Depression</h2><p>Fans are certain that Delevingne is suffering, and others believe it may be related to her melancholy. In September 2017, she spoke out about her sadness, stating she felt “something black” inside her.&nbsp;“I despised myself for being melancholy, I despised feeling miserable, I despised the emotion.” So I was extremely excellent at entirely disassociating from feelings. “I was second-guessing myself the whole time, saying something and then hating myself for saying it,” the model said.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Cara-Delevingne.jpg alt="Cara Delevingne" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She “hated” appearing like a guy as a child since she stood out from her friends.

She broke down at the age of 15 and said that she “didn’t want to be alive anymore.” But she stated that she had moved on from her problems and was now happy.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiamqqRYrGmuMSvoKefnprAbr7EnJynrF2rtrOty2atopyVpHqprdJmo56cXam8br%2FPnpqupJGptrC6jK2fmqxdqLWmecisZK6mlJq%2FbsDHnmSippahwqa6wp5kqJ5dmb%2B2s9Jo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
