Shepard spoke up to co-host Monica Padman about his time with former child actress Ashley Olsen, 35, on the newest edition of his podcast Armchair Expert, which aired last Monday. When reminiscing on his previous romance, Shepard said he was “thunderstruck” by Olsen’s beauty when they first met. During a conversation with Padman about Olsen, whom he began seeing “15 (or) 16 years” ago, the actor stated:</p><p>“I just saw her at a party and was taken aback by her attractiveness.”</p><h2>Dax Shepard would welcome his ex-girlfriend Ashley Olsen.</h2><p>Shepard confessed to his co-host during a discussion about Padman’s affinity for the Olsen twins’ apparel company, The Row:</p><p>“I dated Ashley Olsen and she’s simply the most amazing lady. She’s amazing.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Dax-Shepard-3.jpg alt="Dax Shepard" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Recognizing that many people thought their combination was “quite strange,” Shepard told Padman that Olsen was “just very hilarious, caustic, and bright.” He further said that he had never seen his ex on Full House, claiming:</p><p>“Fortunately, I never watched the show. Because I probably wouldn’t have been able to be drawn to Ashley if I knew her as a baby.”</p><p>The father-of-two said that he enjoys hearing from Padman about the success of Olsen’s clothing company since he was by her side when she launched it with her twin sister Mary-Kate. He stated:</p><p>“We were dating at a time when she was devoting all of her work and effort to launching it in a huge manner. So I got to see her meet with design teams and, like, run her s*** and handle her B (business), which was very impressive.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Dax-Shepard-2.jpg alt="Dax Shepard" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Shepard revealed that Olsen owned a black Cadillac DeVille DTS when they were dating, recalling how they bonded over their love of cars. He went on to say that the Olsen twins are “f***ing tremendous bosses.” according to the actor:</p><p>“I’d want to reconnect with her to see whether she has that DTS.”</p><p>Dax Shepard moved on after his marriage to Kristen Bell in 2013.
