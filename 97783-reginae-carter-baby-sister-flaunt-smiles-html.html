And Carter absolutely dotes on her baby sister, regularly sharing photos with the 5-month-old little girl.</p><p class=fh>A recent image she shared showed the precious tot sitting on the table in front of her as she held her upright in a sitting position, smiling from over the baby's shoulder.</p><p class=fh>The sisters appeared to be sitting at a dining room table at home, with Carter wearing a burnt orange jacket with white accents.</p><p class=fh>The baby girl, who has been named Reign Ryan Rushing, wore a khaki green onesie with ruffled floral sleeves, and an adorable baby pink bow tied around her head. Both sisters were smiling, although Reign seemed unsure of where the camera was.</p><p class=fh>In the background, behind a sofa, a play ring presumably belonging to Reign could be seen.</p><p class=fh>"Hi stinka," Carter captioned the beautiful photo, with two red heart emojis.</p><p class=fh>Another image Carter shared that showed her little sister also included their mother. The three appeared to be all dressed up for a day out in the image.</p><p class=fh>Wright wore a pair of high waisted jeans, a white tank top, and a long cardigan with a floral pattern across the white fabric. She also carried a wooden bag, andd left her long black hair loose.</p><p class=fh>Carter wore a matching shorts and crop top outfit with a blue and white pattern across it, and a frill hanging off the bottom of both. She alos had on a pair of pink sunglasses, and carried her baby sister on her hip.</p><p class=fh>The tot had traded her pink bow for a blue one on this occasion, and had a bib on over her blue and white outfit.</p><p class=fh>Just two years ago two of Wright's brothers were found shot dead in a car. Carter was just as devastated at the loss of her uncles as her mother was, and paid tribute to them on the anniversary of their deaths.</p><p class=fh>"We miss you guys . So much . Today makes 2 Years since I heard Rudy laugh or seen josh smile . It’s hard losing someone who means so much to you but it gives me peace in my heart knowing you guys are in a better place . I love y’all so much. #justice4rudyandjosh," she wrote in the caption of the throwback photo.</p><p class=fh>Wright shared a tribute post of her own on the anniversary, writing:</p><p class=fh>“God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference. #itsbeentwoyears #JusticeforRudyandJosh #imissmybrothers #rudyandjoshforever.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jnJucHBjYr%2Bms8inmJ5lk5a%2FtbHRZpmamqliwKq%2F056pZp6clsKvwIyspKKklah7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
