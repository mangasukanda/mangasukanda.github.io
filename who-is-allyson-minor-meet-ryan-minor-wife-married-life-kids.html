After retiring from baseball, Minor spent a long time as a baseball coach and manager for various organizations.</p><h2>Who Are Ryan Minor’s Wife and Children?</h2><p>Ryan was extremely close to his family, and Allyson is now playing a vital role in dealing with the consequences of his death. Furthermore, Allyson and Ryan Minor have been dating for 26 years and married for 23 years. Ryan and Allyson met when he joined the Delmarva Shorebirds for the next Minor League season.</p><p>When Allyson first met Ryan, her stepfather, a major baseball fan, requested for his autograph.
