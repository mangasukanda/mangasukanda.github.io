The next slide showed a happy story hanging out with his friends as they enjoyed a meal.</p><p class=Fg>In the accompanying caption, the country music star explained that his older daughter traveled all the way from Alabama to spend time with her baby sister.</p><p class=Fg>The doting father praised his daughters’ fashion sense and referenced the Netflix series “Anne with An E,” as he <a class="Vc -G" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B7U2Ea8lJsX/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=Fg>“Channeling her own inner ‘Anne with an E’ in her pretty new @sondeflor dress, they set out to have dinner and go see the movie Little Women together.”</p><p class=Fg>Rory ended the post by explaining that although Indy didn’t make it to the movie, he was able to snag some time to hang with his buddies. <a class="Vc -G" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://countryfancast.com/heidi-hopie-feek-positive/>According</a> to Country Fancast, Heidi follows in her father’s footsteps of being a talented musician.</p><p class=Fg>The 32-year-old began her career in 2010 singing as a backup for “Joey + Rory.” She then went on to release two solo EP’s before joining Dillion Hodges for his North America tour in 2015.</p><p class=Fg>When it comes to being a father to three girls, <a class="Vc -G" href=#>Rory </a>has had quite a rollercoaster journey. <a class="Vc -G" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://tasteofcountry.com/rory-feek-once-upon-a-farm-daughters-lesbian-atheist/>According</a> to Taste of Country, Rory faced a hard time as a father after his wife Joey died of cancer in 2016.</p><p class=Fg>It was noted by the publication that shortly after Joey’s demise, Rory’s Christian faith got rested when his second-oldest daughter Hopie came out to him as a lesbian.</p><p class=Fg>To make matters worse, Heidi also told him that she was an atheist and didn’t believe in organized religion.
