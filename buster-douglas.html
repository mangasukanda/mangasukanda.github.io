Buster earned a total of $27.1 million from these two fights, which is equivalent to almost $56 million in today’s currencies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Buster Douglas?</h2><p>He is estimated to be worth $15 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Buster Douglas’s net worth?</h2><p>He is currently 63 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Buster Douglas’s career?</h2><p>Buster Douglas was born James Douglas in 1960. His father, renowned boxer William “Dynamite” Douglas, raised him in Columbus, Ohio’s primarily black Linden area. Douglas was exposed to boxing by his father, who operated a gym at the Blackburn Recreation Center. Douglas attended Linden McKinley High School, where he played football and basketball. In 1977, he led his squad to the Class AAA state championship.</p><p>Douglas continued his basketball career with the Coffeyville Community College Red Ravens in Coffeyville, Kansas. After that, he played basketball for Sinclair Community College in Dayton, Ohio, before attending Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, on scholarship.</p><p>Douglas made his professional boxing debut in May 1981, defeating Dan O’Malley over four rounds. He won his first five fights before losing his sixth to David Bey in a knockout. Douglas went on to win six consecutive fights before drawing with Steffen Tangstad in October 1982.</p><p>Over the next two years, he defeated largely journeyman opponents, including Jesse Clark, whom he faced and knocked out three times. Another significant fight came against former heavyweight contender Randall “Tex” Cobb, who he defeated by a majority decision.</p><p>Douglas defeated previous champion Greg Page in 1986, which helped him qualify for the International Boxing Federation championships. However, after starting well against Tony Tucker, he lost momentum and was halted in the tenth round.</p><p>Douglas and his trainer father had divorced in the late 1980s due to a series of arguments. He went on to choose another squad and a new trainer. Douglas then won four straight fights. In 1989, he defeated Trevor Berbick by unanimous decision, followed by another unanimous decision victory over future heavyweight champion Oliver McCall.</p><p>Buster Douglas was set to face undisputed heavyweight champion Mike Tyson at the Tokyo Dome in February 1990. Almost all commentators predicted Tyson to easily win the fight; in fact, the odds were so stacked in his favor that almost every Las Vegas betting parlor refused to hold them.</p><p>Douglas surprised almost everyone by dominating the battle from start to finish. By the fifth round, Tyson’s left eye had swelled from Douglas’ many right jabs. Because Tyson’s cornermen had not anticipated such a hurdle, they came without an end well or an ice pack and thus had to put tap water in a latex glove to utilize on Tyson’s eye.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpusrKyVp3qlu9Sgo5qrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
