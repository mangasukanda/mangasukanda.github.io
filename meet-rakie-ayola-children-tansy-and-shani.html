She has also appeared in television shows like Black Mirror, Noughts + Crosses, Doctor Who, Silent Witness, and EastEnders. She portrayed Kyla Tyson in the eighth through eleventh series of the BBC medical drama Holby City.</p><p>A Nigerian father and a Sierra Leonean mother founded Ayola in Cardiff. Her mother’s cousin and his wife raised her in Ely, Cardiff.</p><p>Ayola is of Yoruba descent, despite not speaking Yoruba, and this is because of her family’s extensive African heritage.</p><p>She left high school before completing her A Levels so she could focus on her acting career. She played a lady-in-waiting at King Arthur’s court in her first acting performance while still in elementary school for the Welsh Eisteddfod.</p><p>In one of her submissions, Rakie made a bold claim that Barbra Streisand’s portrayal of Dolly in Hello, Dolly! motivated her to pursue acting as a career as a child, but she actually credits her adoptive mother’s support.</p><p>Ayola’s first job was selling jeans at Cardiff’s Bessemer Road Market. She was a chambermaid while she was in drama school. She received a job offer from the “Made in Wales” theater company six weeks before she was set to graduate, which enabled her to apply for her union card.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rakie Ayola Children: Meet Tansy and Shani</h2><p>Only a few months after the talented and award-winning actress’s marriage, Tansy, her first child, was born in July 2004. In January 2009, Shani, her second child, was born. The fact is that Rakie Ayola has successfully made sure that details about her children are private, hence there is little information about her children in the public domain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rakie Ayola movies</h2><p>Throughout her enviable and reputable career, Rakie Ayola has starred in several movies and some of these movies are Great Moments in Aviation, The Secret Laughter of Women, The I Inside, Sahara, Now Is Good, Dredd, and Been So Long.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rakie Ayola awards</h2><p>Ayola was nominated and made the shortlist for the 2006 Screen Nation Awards’ ‘Female Performance in TV’ award for her portrayal of Kyla Tyson in Holby City. She received an Honorable Mention after being nominated for the same position again the following year.</p><p>WalesOnline ranked Ayola as the 29th sexiest woman in Wales in 2005. Rakie is an ambassador for PIPA (Parents in Performing Arts) and a trustee for the Actors’ Children’s Trust.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rakie Ayola charity works</h2><p>Ayola has spoken out frequently about racial discrimination in the entertainment industry over the course of her career. She explained her motivations by saying that she is not overtly political and that all she wants is fairness. Black actors, in Ayola’s opinion, are underappreciated compared to their white counterparts.</p><p>Ayola established a production company in 2001 and produced the short film Persephone’s Playground. In order to further her cause for more black representation in theater, movies, and television, she screened the movie at the Cannes Film Festival.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the project was largely a failure. Ayola pledged her support in 2008 for the Action for Southern Africa initiative Dignity! Period, which sought to give Zimbabwean women access to affordable sanitary protection.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rakie Ayola Personal Life</h2><p>Ayola presents herself as legitimate, honest, apathetic, and pessimistic. She spends her free time watching TV, going to the movies, watching shows, climbing walls indoors, and practicing yoga and other heart-pumping exercises to stay in shape.</p><p>She holds a variety of Savage dolls underneath her shower. Ayola enjoys traveling and has, among other things, been to Kenya and Peru.</p><p>She has a sincere desire to travel to Brazil and Argentina and has the romantic notion of driving a camper van across Europe.</p><p>Ayola frequently talks about how proud she is of her Welsh upbringing and completely presents herself as an Ely young lady. In 2003, she received the distinction of Individual of the Prestigious Welsh School of Music and Show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqacnqxdp66stcRmmLKnnJZ6pLTIpZurnZ5iwaK60rJkmqaUYsCprc2iZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
