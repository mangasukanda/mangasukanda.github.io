Helmut died in Long Island, New York, on Monday, March 28, 2022. He and the well-known television actress had been married for 53 years, beginning in 1969.</p><p>The cause of death for the TV producer was not immediately disclosed, but his family asked that instead of sending flowers, well-wishers donate to the American Stroke Association.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Susan-Lucc-1.jpg><h2>Children Of&nbsp; Susan Lucci And Helmut Huber</h2><p>Liza Huber (47) and Andreas Huber (47) were the proud parents of the late soap opera star and her late husband (34). Liza, their first child, followed in her mother’s footsteps and became a television actress.</p><p>While Susan is best known for her role as Erica Lane in All My Children, Liza is best known for her role as Gwen Hotchkiss in the soap opera Passions.</p><p>She appeared on the show from 1999 to 2008, but she left the show soon after to raise her family. Liza and her husband, Alexander George Hesterberg III, have four sons: Royce, 14; Brendan, 13; Hayden, 10; and Mason, 8.</p><p>She also owns Sage Spoonfuls, a company that sells homemade baby food and storage. Andreas Huber, Susan and Helmut’s second child, will be 34 years old in 2022. He is currently the CEO of Locality Media, based in Garden City, New York, but he shares his father’s passion for golf. In high school and college, the star kid pursued his passion for golf. In 1998, he won the Big East Championship (both individually and as a team) for Georgetown University.</p><p>He took a break from golf to pursue a Wall Street career, but he later returned to play on the Canadian PGA Tour and the European Challenge Tour.</p><h2>Helmut Huber Passes Away At The Age Of 84</h2><p>According to Susan Lucci’s representative, “Helmut’s passing is a tremendous loss for all who knew and loved him.”</p><p>“He was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, and friend.” ‘The family respectfully requests privacy during this extremely difficult time.’</p><p>He was a family man, a loyal friend, and [he] loved them deeply,’ said a rep for the Huber family.</p><p>Helmut, a native Austrian, was born in 1937. He was invited to join the Austrian Ski Team due to his talent for the sport, but he instead chose to complete an apprenticeship at Hotel Maria Theresia, which is surrounded by four ski slopes. According to Fox News, Helmut later studied at L’Ecole Hoteliere, a hospitality and hotel management school in Lausanne, Switzerland, before moving to North America at the age of 21.</p><p>After beginning his hospitality career in Canada, the youngster moved to New York City at 23 and quickly became an American citizen.</p><h2>Susan Lucci And Helmut Huber Relationship</h2><p>Helmut Huber and Susan Lucci met for the first time in Long Island, New York, in the summer of 1965.</p><p>Susan was 18 years old and a student at Marymount College at the time. She was working as a waitress at the Garden City Hotel when she met Helmut, who was working as a chef and the head of food and beverage service at the time. Helmut revealed in a People interview in 1999 that it was love at first sight.</p><p>“I got really lucky because I married somebody who is smart and handsome, very confident, and has a great sense of humor,” the All My Children actress said in 2020.</p><p>“And, thankfully, he hasn’t just been supportive, which is a lovely word. He’s been there for me, hands-on and right there. He’s been a rock for me, and I got lucky because how could I have known all of that going in? ‘I was 22 years old.’</p><p>When Susan’s acting career took off, Helmut became her manager. He then moved into the production industry, eventually becoming the CEO of Pine Valley Productions.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiknp2kYsC2v8CnZKWtk5i2bq3NnWShnZyiwrV5x66ZnqqjYrCptcudqZ6mXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
