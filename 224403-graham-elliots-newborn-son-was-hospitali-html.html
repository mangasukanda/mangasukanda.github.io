He has also worked in "MasterChef" and "MasterChef Jr." and owns a very successful restaurant named Graham Elliot.</p><p class=dh>Speaking of his restaurant, it has been running since May 2008 and quickly became one of the 15 restaurants in the US to receive <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bravotv.com/people/graham-elliot-bowles>two Michelin stars</a>, one of the most prestigious recognitions in the culinary industry.</p><p class=dh>The chef's career has been nothing short of amazing.

In total, he spent six days there, which was probably one of the most challenging times for the Elliots. About it, Graham <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/masterchef-graham-elliot-son-hospitalized/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"They ran every test imaginable and they all came back negative. To see your kid hooked up to so many things, it's tough to stay positive."</p><p class=dh>Graham also admitted that Jedidiah would open his eyes for "maybe five minutes" a day, something that deeply affected him and Allie, who had plenty of "crying and breakdown moments."</p><p class=dh>Eventually, doctors found out that the boy was suffering from a viral infection and sent him home with his parents after he went 24 hours with a normal temperature.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>GRAHAM ELLIOT'S WEIGHT-LOSS JOURNEY</strong></p><p class=dh>The "MasterChef" judge is also the protagonist of an impressive <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/diets/967201/graham-elliot-weight-loss>weight-loss journey</a>!

Being healthy for his family was what really made him embark on his weight-loss journey.</p><p class=dh>For that reason, he underwent a surgical procedure called sleeve gastrectomy in which his stomach was reduced to a considerably smaller size (about 85 percent of it was eliminated, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/graham-elliot-being-healthy-my-family-was-trigger-losing-130-2D11722244>said Graham</a>).</p><p class=dh>In less than six months, the restauranteur lost 130 pounds and changed his eating and exercise habits.
