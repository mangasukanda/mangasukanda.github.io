Zoie is the only child of Hollywood actress Jodie Sweetin’s marriage to her ex-husband Cody Herpin.</strong></p><h2><span id=Where_was_Zoie_Laurel_May_Herpin_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Zoie Laurel May Herpin born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>According to her mother, Jodie Sweetin’s first child is now a big girl who isn’t afraid to speak her mind and knows how to set boundaries. Zoie is 14 years old, having been born to celebrity parents on<strong> April 10, 2008.</strong> She was born in America, and the child comes from a Caucasian family.</p><p>Growing up has been fun for Zoie, who has a younger sister and parents who work together to make sure she has everything she needs. Despite the fact that she is still of school age, no information about Jodie Sweetin’s daughter’s school is available. Regardless, she will graduate from high school and either work full-time for her mother or attend college.</p><h2><span id=She_is_aspiring_to_be_an_actress>She is aspiring to be an actress</span></h2><p>Not to say that Zoie is now a professional actress scouting for roles, but she is well on her way. Both Zoie and her younger half-sister Beatrix appeared on Fuller House at different points. Beatrix first appeared in the season 4 episode “President Fuller,” while Zoie first appeared in the season 2 episode “A Tangled Web.”</p><p>Aside from her obvious interest in acting, Zoie is active on social media, as are most young people her age. She has some viral videos, especially on TikTok, where she recruited Jodie to participate in a viral dance video. Zoie is more concerned with maturing than with establishing a career for the time being. Only time will tell whether she will pursue acting full-time or find another calling.</p><h2><span id=Her_parents_had_been_married_for_three_years_when_she_was_born>Her parents had been married for three years when she was born</span></h2><p>Jodie Sweeting and Cody Herpin were married from 2007 to 2010, and their only child was born during their second year together. The actress married Herpin after divorcing her first husband, Shaun Holguin, in 2006. After her first marriage ended in divorce, Sweetin met Cody Herpin the following year.</p><p>Friends introduced her to the film transportation coordinator, and the two quickly began dating in May 2007. Their wedding took place in Las Vegas, Nevada, on July 24, 2007, and their daughter, Zoie, was born a year later, in 2008.</p><h2><span id=Zoie_was_born_the_same_year_her_parents8217_marriage_ended>Zoie was born the same year her parents’ marriage ended</span></h2><p>Even though their divorce was finalized in 2010, the process of dissolving their marriage began in 2008. The birth of their daughter would seem to strengthen their bond, but this was not the case. Instead, they began to drift apart as soon as they married.</p><p>On November 19, 2008, Sweetin took the audacious step of filing for legal separation from Herpin. Their divorce was finalized on April 20, 2010, and the couple moved on with their lives, with Jodie married Morty Coyle in 2012, but she divorced him in 2016. She announced her engagement to Mescal Wasilewski on January 17, 2022.</p><p>According to publicly available information, Cody Herpin has yet to marry again. He has only married Jodie Sweetin so far, and they share custody of their daughter, though Jodie is said to pay child support to her ex-husband. Cody Herpin’s real name is Cody Herpin, and despite working as a film transportation coordinator, he is best known as Jodie Sweetin’s ex. In contrast to Zoie’s mother, a well-known movie star, her father works behind the scenes.</p><h2><span id=Father_of_Zoie_Laurel_May_Herpin>Father of Zoie Laurel May Herpin</span></h2><p>Cody is a White American man who was born on April 28, 1977 in the United States. His job as a film transportation coordinator kept him out of the spotlight until he married Jodie. As a result of his marriage to the actress, he was thrust into the spotlight.</p><p>In addition to the transport department, he has worked in the art and transportation departments of the film industry. Cody’s credits include Ladron que roba a lardon, Unearthed Krews, Faith Happens, Resident Evil: Extinction, and American Cowslip.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
