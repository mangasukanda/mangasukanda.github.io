He had then dropped out and moved to Seoul to pursue an acting career.</li><li>There, he had been scouted to be an aspiring K-Pop idol and was also trained to sing. When he had acted in his first TV commercial, he had changed his name from Uhm Hong-sik to Yoo Ah-in because his first management had wanted to create a stage name for him that fitted an idol image. The ‘Ah-In’ part of his name was taken from the German word ‘ein’ which means ‘one’, which implies uniqueness.</li><li>In 2016, he was ranked 2nd in Forbes Korea magazine’s ‘Power Celebrity’ list, an annual compilation of the top 40 most powerful celebrities in South Korea.</li><li>In 2017, he had been diagnosed with a bone tumor which had delayed his mandatory military service stint (South Korea requires male citizens between the ages of 18 and 28 to perform compulsory military service for about 2 years). The tumor was later found to be non-cancerous. In June 2017, it was announced that he had been exempt from military service after he had failed 5 medical examinations.</li><li>He was the first Asian actor to be chosen as a global model for the Italian retail clothing company Diesel as well as&nbsp;the first Korean actor to be named a brand ambassador for the French luxury goods conglomerate Cartier.</li><li>Besides his acting career, he has also worked as a freelance writer. He was the&nbsp;chief editor of the fashion magazine Tom Paper (2014-2016) and has contributed several columns for magazines like InStyle Korea and Movieweek.</li><li>He had donated his modeling fees from the luxury fashion house Balenciaga‘s ‘WFP 2021 Spring Collection’ to Balenciaga and World Food Programme (the food-assistance branch of the United Nations)’s 2021 ‘Zero Hunger’ campaign.</li><li>In February 2023, Yoo Ah-in was investigated for drug use and had later tested positive for marijuana. Later that month, it was confirmed that he had also tested positive for propofol. In March 2023, he had reportedly tested positive for cocaine and ketamine.</li><li>In April 2023, it was revealed that he was being investigated for zolpidem use.</li><p>Featured Image by Yoo Ah-in / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jrKmqGWRnXqquo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
