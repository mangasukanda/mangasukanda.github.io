The thrilling drama chronicles a messy rise to power and is just one glimpse into American politics provided by one show out of many equally gripping series.</p><p class=dh>Congressman Frank Underwood is set on exacting revenge on those who betrayed him. He enlists the help of his "equally conniving" wife, Carrie, but it's only the beginning as the couple doesn't stop there.</p><p class=dh>While their story begins with a sickening revenge plot, a gripping pursuit for more power ensues as they make more than a few morally questionable decisions to get from one level to the next. And in "House of Cards," most figures care little, if at all, about being good people.</p><p class=dh>Described as a "grim reflection" of American politics, the fictional storylines in "House of Cards" reveal an alarming truth about real-world politicians. Yet, audiences often find rooting for even the most conniving fictional ones more cathartic.</p><p class=dh>Trevor Parry-Giles, a professor of political communication at the University of Maryland, said this is partially because, despite their methods, fictional political leaders <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obsessed-house-cards/story?id=29223231"><u>get things done</u></a>, a characteristic many feel real-world leaders lack.</p><p class=dh>This trait can be attributed to Carrie (<a class="me a" href=#><u>Robin Wright</u></a>) and Frank (<a class="me a" href=#><u>Kevin Spacey</u></a>). Alongside Wright and Spacey, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856010/><u>the show</u></a>, adapted from the eponymous 1990s BBC version, also starred <a class="me a" href=#><u>Kate Mara</u></a> and Michael Kelly.</p><p class=dh>For more seat-gripping political drama and some commentary on the failures and successes of current governing systems — some with a bit of satire and comedy — find a list of series <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://collider.com/best-most-fascinating-political-series-netflix-right-now/#39-house-of-cards-39-2013---2018><u>as enticing as</u></a> "House of Cards" below.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>'Designated Survivor' (2016 – 2019)</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>For three seasons, "Designated Survivor" chronicled the life of low-level Cabinet member Tom Kirkman after being <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRA1gb3SJtw"><u>told</u></a>, "Sir, you are now the President of the United States."
