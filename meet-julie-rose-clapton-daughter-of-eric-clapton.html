He is ranked as the 18th greatest rock performer in history.</p><p>When he was just 17 years old, he started his musical journey. “The Roosters” was the first ensemble he played in. His ex-wife, Pattie Boyd, amassed her impressive $20 million net worth working as a model, writer, and photographer.</p><h2><span id=The_Story_of_Parents8217_Affection>The Story of Parents’ Affection</span></h2><p>Julie’s mother’s name is Melia McEnery. She first encountered Eric Patrick Clapton in 2018 at an event in Columbus, Ohio. After his show, Eric was given a reception at the office where Melia served as an administrative assistant.</p><p>At the time, Melia was only 22 years old and Eric was 53. After the celebration, they dated for a while before making their relationship public in 1999. After dating a partner for almost three years, they decided to get married.</p><p>In Eric’s birthplace of Ripley, on January 1, 2002, they were wed at St. Mary Magdalene Church. There are three kids born to Eric and Melia. The eldest of her siblings is Julie. Her two younger sisters are Ella May Clapton (born January 14, 2003) and Sophia Belle Clapton (born February 1, 2005).</p><p>Her father was previously wed to English model, writer, and photographer Pattie Boyd in 1979. Pattie was married to George Harrison when Eric first encountered her in the late 1960s.</p><p>Pattie refused to quit her marriage to be with Eric even though he had feelings for her. It is thought that Eric wrote the song “Layla” to express his affection for Pattie. Their union was destined to fall apart. When he was drunk, Eric admitted to being aggressive toward his then-wife Pattie.</p><p>Eric committed infidelity as well. In January 1985, while still married to Pattie, he had a daughter as a result of his relationship with Yvonne Kelly.</p><p>Ruth Kelly Clapton was his daughter, whom he gave the name, and he kept her a secret from the public until 1991 when the media learned she was his child. Every time they tried to get pregnant, Eric and Pattie were unsuccessful.</p><p>They even attempted in vitro fertilization, but in 1984 they experienced losses. They separated in the year 1988. Lory Del Santo, an Italian model, was the object of his affection. They gave birth to a boy named Conor Clapton on August 21, 1986.</p><p>Conor jumped out of an open bedroom window on the 53rd floor of a Manhattan apartment building on March 20, 1991, and perished at the age of four. Conor Clapton is the stepbrother of Julie Rose Clapton’s father, Eric Clapton. One of Eric’s most well-known songs is this one. For the same composition, Eric received six additional Grammy nominations.</p><p>The Father of Julie Rose Clapton, Eric Clapton, has always had a passion for Ferrari. When he was younger, he admitted to being a huge fan of auto racing.</p><p>He mentioned Mike Hawthorn, Fangio, Alfa Romeo, Mercedes, and Alto Union, and he remembered them from when he was five or six years old. Eric explained how the car had v12 and v16 engines in the past when it was much larger.</p><p>Because he admired Ferrari, which was and is still No. 1 at the moment, he claimed that he had always wanted to be a racing driver. He responded that Felipe Nasr is a friend and that he highly admires him when asked if he still followed racing and visited race tracks.</p><p>He said that when he writes a song, plays a play, or performs, he has a standard in mind because he has a perfectionist issue, much like Ferrari is flawless with its minutiae.</p><p>When asked about the similarities he sees between writing a song and creating a fantastic vehicle, he said that he has standards in mind when he does each of those things.</p><p>Clapton admits that he still has problems with computers and cellphones regarding technology. He argues that being ignorant in some way serves him well because it makes him appreciate the value of being able to perform.</p><p>Eric has a collection of Ferrari vehicles, with the Lusso and 612 Scaglietti being his faves. He also has a Ferrari GTO 599 in his possession.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Guitarist</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Singer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Josh Groban And Natalie McQueen Announced Their Relationship Officially</a></h3>On Instagram, Josh Groban and Natalie McQueen announced their engagement.
