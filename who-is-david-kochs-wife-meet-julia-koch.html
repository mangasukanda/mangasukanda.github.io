There, she assisted fashion designer Adolfo and fitted Nancy Reagan.</p><p>In January 1991, she went on a blind date with David Koch, but the encounter did not go well. “I’m pleased I met that guy because now I know I never want to go out with him,” she said later when she was asked how she felt.</p><p>Later that year, however, they reconnected at a party and began dating. They were married in May 1996 at David Koch’s Southampton home on Meadow Lane after she ceased working there in 1993.</p><p>She made what the New York Times referred to as her “New York social debut” at the Met Gala in December 1997.
