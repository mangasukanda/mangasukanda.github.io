It got so bad that, at one point, she was homeless for days.</p><p class=dh>Margot Kidder was a Hollywood sensation in the early 80s, taking the world by storm with her role as the female lead in "Superman." But where did her story begin?</p><p class=dh>Kidder was born to mining Engineer Kendall Kidder and his wife Jill, a homemaker. She was the secondborn in a family of five children, but even soon after birth, it was evident she was smart as a whip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2957de567695029ca959e3d53d9be17a53f9c57939bcdabd72d81ada6f861080.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Margot Kidder appearing in the ABC tv movie "The Wide World of Mystery" | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>She portrayed star-like qualities since she was a little girl, with her Vancouver Magee Secondary School teacher Ruth Rapanos <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-starting-over-vol-46-no-13/>saying</a> Margot "was like a little star."</p><p class=dh>However, she also suffered from manic depression. She would experience bouts of mood swings, and as a teen, she even tried taking her own life. However, by the next day, she would return to her usual self.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/adc6f953a7e17ccf51b9216615411c3788e97c86fce99c76e07e2a0b25cd889c.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actress Margot Kidder poses for a portrait in 1985 in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In her adulthood, the actress got <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/the-education-of-margot-kidder-630259/>married thrice</a>. Her first marriage was to novelist Thomas McGuane in 1976, resulting in a daughter, Maggie, that same year. She stopped taking on roles and became a housewife, keen on looking after her daughter. However, she always longed to return to acting.</p><p class=dh>The union was short-lived, and she and McGuane divorced in 1977. Two years later, Kidder married actor John Heard, a marriage that lasted a record six days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/84385ddf6d982966f47bf1c3fe30bed5bc1cd51be337afd55cad583c2e86e49b.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actress Margot Kidder and daughter Maggie McGuane on February 4, 1988 at Mont Sainte-Anne Ski Resort in Beaupre, Quebec, Canada | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>A few years later, she tried her luck at marriage again and walked down the aisle with French director Philippe de Broca in 1983. That, too, lasted a year, and the pair divorced in 1984.</p><p class=dh>Before she wed for the second time, she made a comeback in film and auditioned for the 1978 superhero cult classic, "Superman," landing the role of the lead female Lois Lane, the girlfriend of the lead male Christopher Reeve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b01f48f8167198695208283da7a06c71c50146c73ff3257d6342ce5a72aab594.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve on Bovember 1, 1982 in New York City, New York, United States. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The film became an instant success, leading to the sequel "Superman II," which also brought her immense fame and recognition.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>The Peak of Margot Kidder's Career and Dealing with a Condition That Left Her Homeless and Lost</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Kidder always knew she wanted to become an actress, and even as early as a child, she was incredibly aware of the great emotions that came with expressing herself freely. During this time, she wrote in her diary that she wanted to become a big movie star.</p><p class=dh>She had the conviction that one day her wish would come true. She did not know how, but the dream was very alive in her heart. As is the way of destiny, her chance came through her father's busy work schedule, which saw her change schools occasionally, prompting her parents to enroll her in a boarding school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/133483aedc83e0848346dfd8fc116f7f511e317e513fb0ada4749a38c76586a1.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actress Margot Kidder as Ruth in "Nichols" | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Unknowingly, they had ignited a fire that would burst into a full-blown acting career. Kidder began participating in school plays, leading in "Romeo and Juliet," and many others.<strong class=bh></strong></p><p class=dh>After graduation, she moved to Los Angeles, where she carved friendships with other struggling filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Susan Sarandon. They would sit around fires talking for hours about how they would change the world.</p><p class=dh>Kidder found herself dealing with plenty of prejudice and hotheads but was lucky enough to meet a Canadian agent, who secured her first role in the 1969 "Gaily, Gaily." That then led to a starring role in "Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c2111c25a3d775cf316762257a5f374ae2c30af2739094afbc606b99c289cb5a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Margot Kidder on an episode of "Nichols." | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>One Christmas season, Kidder became involved with Brian Russell De Palma, who gave her the script for "Sisters" as a Christmas gift.

In 1987, she appeared in her third "Superman" film, "Superman IV: The Quest for Peace." However, her roles began dwindling in the '90s.</p><p class=dh>Her stardom days were over, and her life was slowly spiraling out of control. Believe it or not, that was just the beginning of the downward trend. In truth, the genesis of her troubles was in 1990, when she suffered an auto accident while working on "Nancy Drew and Daughter." The accident left her confined to a wheelchair for a while.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/29ecba05b853b156f65c257e61a747dfa5da1934b4a8aecdb16c00bdfeecc926.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Margot Kidder at the Chiller Theatre in 2007 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>And while a back operation two years later restored her ability to walk, the medical bills, amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars, left her bankrupt. Adding insult to injury, she became addicted to pain pills and alcohol.</p><p class=dh>She did seek help, even joining a 12-step group, but sadly, the worst was yet to come. Unfortunately, her manic depression manifested hugely in the mid-'90s, and in 1996, her condition took control of her life.</p><p class=dh>During one manic episode, the actress was found disheveled and disoriented, hiding in a backyard in Los Angeles with her tooth missing.

She said to them that her ex-husband had hired people to kill her, but anchorman Ted Hall, who recognized her, thought there was no truth to her claims. It did not help her story that she looked dirty and tired. She also had no purse as she had discarded it earlier, believing it had a bomb.</p><p class=dh>Early the following day, she took a taxi but could not pay for the trip because she had no money on her.

But even in her state, she still looked out for others. She recalled seeing a homeless man light a pipe and telling him not to do that to his body. The man asked her not to judge, and Kidder <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-starting-over-vol-46-no-13/>recalls</a> thinking:</p><p class=dh>"He's right.

But the search did not look too promising, and at some point, the police even told her how unsure they were that they'd find Kidder alive.</p><p class=dh>On April 22, Kidder set off to see a friend who lived about 12 miles north of downtown Los Angeles. She tried her best to disguise herself, afraid that her ex-husband was pursuing her. That evening, Kidder spent the night in a motel and the next day began walking up what <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-starting-over-vol-46-no-13/>she said</a> was an "endless mountain," thinking how much life had changed.</p><p class=dh>But even though life had handed her the short end of the stick, she had a moment of clarity and remembered she was still the Kidder people loved.
