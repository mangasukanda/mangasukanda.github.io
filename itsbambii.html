The journey from being a gay male to accepting feminity is not easy anyway. In one of her videos on YouTube, the vlogger revealed that since her childhood she wanted to be with girls and was inclined to all things girls did.</p><p>The boys in her class often teased Bambii by calling her a faggy and it was very difficult for her to grow up this way. To survive she blocked out all the memories of her childhood because they made her very angry. She was not being able to express what she was going through depressed Bambii. In times of distress, she would take out her anger on her mother because she had nobody to talk about it and also didn’t know how to express it.</p><p>In the ninth grade, her mother asked her if she was gay and she blurted out that she was indeed so. She behaved badly with her mother and sister and at one time even choked her sister. Her mother found her sexuality hard to accept and took her to a therapist. From that day onwards Itsbambii started being herself. It is her strong will and resilience that has made her unique.</p><p>The followers of Itsbambii were shocked after she came out with a video ‘I Don’t Want To Be Female Anymore’ declaring that she was de-transitioning and would be a male again. She regrets that people behave badly with her and recognize her more as a male. But towards the end of the video, she is quite sure that she wants to stick to her feminine identity.</p><h4><span>Relationship Status</span></h4><p>She started a relationship with YouTuber<strong> Ricky Day</strong> in 2017. There is no more information about her dating history. Likewise, there are no rumors regarding her personal and professional life.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Itsbambii is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs around 63 kgs.
