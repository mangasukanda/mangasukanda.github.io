Sidibe made it known that they found the first pumpkin as she hilariously gushed over the giant and fleshy pumpkin. She <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGyE1iXpSFa/?igshid=1tzkylodfqftl">informed</a> fans in her caption:</p><p class=Zg>"We went pumpkin picking…"</p><p class=Zg>Fans in the comments reeled with joy as they applauded the duo for finding a perfect pumpkin.

I was never going to offer them anything. I would not cook for men or take care of men…"</p><p class=Zg>Shortly after making that pact, the "Antebellum" star found love in the arms of Frankel. The duo has since been staying together amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p class=Zg>Sidibe's love interest had the sweetest post up on social media as he and his girlfriend rang in the new year.
