It’s critical to take into account the larger context of their circumstance.</p><p>Their financial problems were exacerbated by the COVID-19 epidemic, which significantly contributed to their problems. These financial difficulties influenced Kisha’s choice to join OnlyFans and Joe’s transition to life after his NBA career.</p><p>The couple’s 13-year history indicates a deeper bond, even if the popular video only shows one dramatic moment. It’s unclear whether they will decide to resolve their differences or break up.</p><p>But their connection is more complicated than a little video clip can portray.</p><p>Divorce is one conceivable result, but it’s not the only way they might deal with their issues.</p><h2><span id=Was_Joe_Smith_Offended_By_Kisha_Chavis8217s_Exclusive_Fans>Was Joe Smith Offended By Kisha Chavis’s Exclusive Fans?</span></h2><p>The widely shared video makes it clear that Joe Smith was not pleased with his wife’s choice to establish an OnlyFans account.</p><p>Joe was very disappointed and frustrated at the time the video was taken since he was unaware of Kisha’s decision. But their almost 13-year connection goes much beyond this one occurrence.</p><p>Kisha chose to sign up for OnlyFans as a result of the couple’s financial struggles. As she said in her interviews, her decision was motivated by a perceived need rather than a selfish desire.</p><p>The conclusion she made was influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic and the intricacies of their financial difficulties.</p><p>Kaitlin Armstrong Is a Genius Celeb Trending Screenshot: Trial and verdict for Moriah Wilson’s murder</p><p>Although it does not provide a whole picture, the widely shared video highlights their relationship’s communication breakdown.</p><h2><span id=Both_Kisha_Chavis_and_Joe_Smith_Details_of_the_Controversy>Both Kisha Chavis and Joe Smith Details of the Controversy</span></h2><p>The difficulties Joe Smith and Kisha Chavis encountered were mostly caused by their financial difficulties as well as the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects.</p><p>Joe had a great NBA career, but his contracts’ financial consequences were shocking; large tax deductions left him with less than he had anticipated. One financial error was the practice of purchasing properties in urban areas.</p><p>He played there, but after moving to another club, he had to sell them, which cost him money. Furthermore, a collection of high-end vehicles was considered a careless expenditure.</p><p>Their $26,000 total income from many sources was insufficient to support a lifestyle that cost more than $133,000. Because Kisha’s attempts to launch enterprises did not provide the desired outcomes, the couple’s debt continued to grow.</p><p>Due to their actions made as a result of this financial strain, Joe and Kisha’s relationship reached a breaking point when Joe learned about her OnlyFans account.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>celebrity culture and social media</a> <a href=# rel=tag>rumors</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is Hannah Edwards | Daughter Of Huw Edwards</a></h3>One of Huw Edwards' two daughters with his wife Vicky Flind is Hannah Edwards.
