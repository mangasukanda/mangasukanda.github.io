Married Life &amp;amp; Kids</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-27</div><p><strong>Arthur Smith</strong>, the former Atlanta Falcons head coach, has three children: two boys and a daughter. Smith has a lovely marriage with his wife, Alison Smith, and they are devoted parents to their three children. In 2006, Smith started his coaching career as a graduate assistant at North Carolina. He then played for the Washington Redskins (2007-2008) and Ole Miss (2010).</p><p>He then went on to work for the Tennessee Titans, where he had numerous positions such as defensive quality control coach, offensive quality control coach, offensive line coach, assistant tight ends coach, offensive coordinator, and tight ends coach.&nbsp;He was hired as the Atlanta Falcons head coach in 2021 as a result of his success with the Titans. Despite a stunning win against the New York Giants, the 2021 season ended with a 7-10 record.</p><p>Furthermore, the trend continued in 2022 but did not in 2023. Smith attracted criticism for his player management, which finally led to his demise.&nbsp;Smith was dismissed by the Falcons on January 8, 2024, after three consecutive 7-10 seasons. By focusing on both wins and disappointments, his coaching biography exemplifies the volatile character of NFL coaching.</p><h2>Arthur Smith’s Children and Wife</h2><p><strong>Arthur Smith and Alison Smith</strong> are a happily married couple with three children. Tanner and William were their boys, while Sophie was their daughter. Allison formerly worked at a small TV station in Green Bay, Wisconsin, according to an interview with Rise Up Tonight. In the same interview, she said that she had not contemplated marrying someone with an NFL connection. She said that her family was not an “NFL Family” and that her brother participated in sports such as soccer and tennis.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arthur-Smith-2.jpg alt="Arthur Smith" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Allison also said that she was proud of her husband for his hard work and devotion to his career. She thanked her spouse for the rest of the interview and expressed her optimism for the future.&nbsp;Despite keeping their relationship quiet, the pair has a strong tie of love and support. They like to keep their relationship and family life private, therefore they have little social media presence.</p><h2>Why Was He Fired By The Falcons?</h2><p><strong>Arthur Smith’s</strong> career as Atlanta Falcons head coach has come to an end. Each year, he finishes his third straight losing season with a 7-10 record. Smith was dismissed after the New Orleans Saints defeated him 48-17.&nbsp;Furthermore, the Falcons, who have had six consecutive losing seasons since 2017, have failed to reach the playoffs under Smith’s leadership. Smith, owner Arthur Blank, and CEO Rich McKay met to make the decision, which was publicized following the meeting.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arthur-Smith-1.jpg alt="Arthur Smith" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The squad failed despite high hopes for the 2023 season, which included free-agent additions and top draft choices. The supporters’ anger escalated, especially after a humiliating defeat to the NFL’s poorest team, the Carolina Panthers. After the departure of longtime starter Matt Ryan, it was evident that Smith would encounter difficulties in resolving the quarterback position. The head coach was also widely chastised for his cautious play-calling and failed to capitalize on recruits.&nbsp;Smith’s three-year coaching tenure with the Falcons comes to an end with his termination, leaving Blank looking for the team’s sixth head coach. The quarterback position is the team’s most pressing concern going ahead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYq6yYqr9uv8yiq6Flp564qnnWobBmr5GoeqmxjJ%2Bgq52UYrOzu8xmmK2kkaPBonnFmqOcp56oeq6t0augnpxdobansYykoJ2rXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
