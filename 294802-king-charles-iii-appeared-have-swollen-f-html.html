While the monarch seemed in good spirits, a photo showing her purple hands sparked concern among British natives.</p><p class=dh>They questioned her health state and whether courtiers needed to turn on the heating at Windsor Castle. The Queen had been on doctors' order rest for more than a month when she hosted an in-person audience with General Sir Nick Carter, the Chief of the Defence Staff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5a77551ce5124cba029a6e9cb2fae373.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Queen Elizabeth II receives General Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, during an audience in the Oak Room at Windsor Castle on November 17, 2021 in Windsor, England | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The pictures - released by Buckingham Palace - showed the monarch and Sir General Carter's hands looking purple.

The purple is due to deoxygenated blood."</p><p class=dh>Per NHS, the said phenomenon is common but does not cause severe issues. It can be treated by keeping warm and usually goes away after a few minutes or hours.</p><p class=dh>That said, Her Majesty had been previously pictured with a purplish blemish on her hands back in 2019. The photos of her purple and blue hands were recent from her last public meeting on September 6, 2022.</p><p class=dh>The monarch had summoned Britain's new Prime Miniter, Liz Truss, to Balmoral Castle in Scotland. The Queen's hands were displayed and sparked conversation on social media when they were pictured shaking hands.</p><p class=dh>There were allegations that she was too frail to travel to England for the ceremony. The said images were shared with the media, leaving citizens to raise concerns about her health as she had dark blue bruised hands.</p><p class=dh>One social media user tweeted on Twitter <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.nypost.com/2022/09/06/queens-blue-hand-sparks-health-concerns-at-liz-truss-meeting/>asking</a>, "What is going on with the Queen's hands?

Moreover, like her, Her Majesty's son, King Charles, seems to have a similar problem with swollen fingers."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>King Charles Has Been Pictured with Red Swollen Fingers - Causing Alarm</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Following the death of the Queen at age 96, her son made headlines after the media and social media caught a glimpse of his red, swollen fingers.</p><p class=dh>Per the Daily Star, Dr. Gareth Nye weighed in on his hands after a social media user asked fellow users whether they had seen his fingers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/93c888ff93439e0ba8587f17238acec4.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Prince Charles during his visit at Gurudwara Bangla Sahib to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak on November 13, 2019 in New Delhi, India | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Following the online speculation, Dr. Nye, a Senior Lecturer at the University of Chester, offered expert advice in an interview with the publication and said multiple conditions could lead to swollen fingers. In contrast, some could be more dominant than others.</p><p class=dh>The medical professional revealed one of the conditions could be edema, or fluid retention, and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/doctor-explains-what-king-charles-27950692>explained</a> what edema is:</p><p class=dh>"Edema is a condition where the body starts to retain fluids in the limbs, normally the legs and ankles, but also in the fingers, which causes them to swell.

He said another possible condition could be arthritis which is also common in people in their 60s and affects three joints in the fingers.</p><p class=dh>"Fingers usually become stiff, painful, and swollen.

Notably, it was not the first time his fingers had raised eyebrows.</p><p class=dh>In his 2019 royal tour to India, His Majesty's fingers were highlighted by royal fans who could not turn a blind eye. King Charles' red fingers and toes were displayed while he was carrying out royal engagements in New Delhi.</p><p class=dh>The royal also visited the Bangla Sahib Gurdwara Sikh Temple, where he stepped into the temple barefoot after taking his shoes off at the holy site. The photos from the event made rounds, showing that he had painful-looking swelling in his feet and hands.</p><p class=dh>In addition to his alarming health, the new British monarch frequently looks red in the face.
