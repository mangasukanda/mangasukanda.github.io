The story was denied and the newspaper was shut down. However, in the subsequent years, the status of this relationship became a topic of intense speculation all over the world. Alina was among the 6 Russian torchbearers who had been selected to carry the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Her selection had generated controversy in the international media because of her alleged relationship with Putin. In March 2015, she was reported to have given birth to a daughter in Ticino, Switzerland. In 2019, she reportedly gave birth to twin sons in Moscow. The Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung reported in 2022 that a Swiss gynecologist of Russian origin had assisted both births. The report alleged that the first birth in 2015 was of a boy and the second in 2019 was of another boy and that both were Putin’s sons. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States Department of the Treasury had proposed sanctions against her. However, the United States government had withheld those sanctions, given her alleged relationship with Putin, to avoid further escalation of tensions between Russia and the United States.</li><h3>Race / Ethnicity</h3><p>White</p><p>She is of Tatar descent on her father’s side and Russian descent on her mother’s side.</p><h3>Hair Color</h3><p>Light Brown</p><h3>Eye Color</h3><p>Blue</p><h3>Sexual Orientation</h3><p>Straight</p><h3>Distinctive Features</h3><ul><li>Toned physique</li><li>Center-parted, long, straight hair</li><li>Cheerful smile</li><li>Gleaming face</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Alina-Kabaeva-as-seen-in-an-Instagram-Post-in-August-2016.jpg><h3>Alina Kabaeva Facts</h3><li>Alina, owing to her father’s sports career, had spent her childhood shuttling between different cities in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia.</li><li>In 2001, she had been featured in the Japanese samurai film, Red Shadow, performing a gymnastics routine.</li><li>She had been featured on the cover of the January 2011 edition of Vogue Russia.</li><li>In 2015, she was an honorary guest at the Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championships held in Stuttgart, Germany.</li><li>In 2017, she was the official FIG Rhythmic Gymnastics Ambassador at the Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championships held in Pesaro, Italy.</li><p>Featured Image by Alina Kabaeva / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpqjoqaRYriirsCerZpn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
