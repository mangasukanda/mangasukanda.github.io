He signed a five and a half years contract with the club.</li><li>In August 2014, he agreed on a contract extension with Everton to extend his contract with the club to 2019. The new contract deal also increased his earning to&nbsp;around £30,000 a week.</li><li>On the back of his impressive performances in Everton’s backline, he managed to earn a nomination for Golden Boy 2014 Award. However, he wasn’t able to overcome eventual winner <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Raheem Sterling</a>.</li><li>In April 2015, he scored his first premier league goal for Everton as he headed in his side’s second goal in their 3-0 victory over Manchester United.</li><li>In the&nbsp;summer of 2015, he was actively pursued by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Jose Mourinho</a>‘s Chelsea. Everton reportedly rejected three bids (£20&nbsp;million, £26&nbsp;million, and £30&nbsp;million) from the London based club. It was even claimed that Stones had submitted a transfer request to force a move. But the report was denied by the club and his representatives.</li><li>In August 2016, Everton agreed a&nbsp;£47.5&nbsp;million deal with Manchester City to allow Stones to eventually leave the club. Everton was also promised further £2.5&nbsp;million in performance and appearances related add-ons.</li><li>His old club Barnsley also received&nbsp;£6.78&nbsp;million from his move to Abu Dhabi owned club because of the 15% sell on clause inserted during his move to Everton.</li><li>His transfer move to Man City made him the second defender after <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>David Luiz</a> to be sold for over&nbsp;£45 million. He was also the second most expensive defender at that time.</li><li>His debut season for Manchester City wasn’t up to&nbsp;the&nbsp;mark as he was regularly criticized for his role in his side’s shambolic performances throughout the season.</li><li>He scored 2 goals in England’s 6-1 annihilation of Panama in the 2018 FIFA World Cup group stage match. His goals made him the first Manchester City player since Trevor Francis in 1982 to score goals for the England National team.</li><li>Follow him on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>.</li><p>Featured Image by&nbsp;Кирилл Венедиктов / <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Soccer.ru</a> / CC BY-SA 3.0</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqOmoaZdqMGwusSsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
